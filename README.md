# DriverRoutingSimulation
Delivery Sim
The efficiency is based on the dollars per KM stat. It does not include the driver fee, or the item's price. It is the dollar amount made in an hour, per a single driver.

The average delivery distance is also based on the distance between the pick up and drop off points. It does not include the distance required to reach the delivery.

The profit made by driver if the total number of routes multiplied by the driver fee.

Company profit is based off of the dollar per KM stat. It is, essentially, how much money is spent on that stat.

The driver's speed is assumed to average at 40KM/H. 

The simulation runs at approximately 10x speed. The stats take that into account.

You can open more than one map at a time by clicking the "Run Simulation" button multiple times

There is a box with the text "DEBUG BOX" in it. If something goes wrong, it should display why here. I haven't had anything appear there in a few iterations, but it is there just in case.

Don't move any of the pieces out of the folder. This will cause it to break.

There is a folder called "Reports". Every time you close the application or click the "Generate Report" it will create a new file in there. It contains all of the information recorded. This can make some overlap.

I think that is it, but I did make it, so I know everything about it. This means I might have looked over something (or a lot of things) in here. If I did, or you have any questions, email me. joel.cright@gmail.com.
